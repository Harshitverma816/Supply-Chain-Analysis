📦 **Supply Chain & Inventory Performance Analysis**

End-to-End Data Analytics Project | Python · SQL · Power BI

🔍 **Business Problem**

Supply chain inefficiencies directly impact costs, delivery performance, and customer satisfaction.
Organizations often struggle with:
- Excess inventory locking working capital
- Stockouts caused by poor demand alignment
- Delivery delays due to logistics bottlenecks
- Lack of visibility into supplier and inventory performance
This project analyzes supply chain operations to identify inefficiencies, uncover bottlenecks, and enable data-driven operational decisions.

🎯 **Project Objectives**
- Evaluate inventory health and stock movement
- Identify logistics delays and delivery performance gaps
- Analyze supplier and product-level performance
- Build an executive-ready dashboard for decision-makers

❓ **Key Business Questions Answered**
- Where is inventory overstocked or underutilized?
- Which products are slow-moving and tying up capital?
- Which regions or routes experience frequent delivery delays?
- How efficient is overall supply chain performance?
- What actions can improve inventory turnover and logistics efficiency?

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python** – Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis
- **SQL (MySQL)** – Structured querying and KPI analysis
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and performance tracking
- **CSV** – Raw data storage
- **PowerPoint / Report** – Business insights and storytelling

🔄 **Analytical Workflow**
1. Data Cleaning & EDA (Python)
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies
   - Created derived metrics for inventory and logistics analysis
   - Identified patterns, trends, and anomalies
2. SQL Analysis
   - Designed queries to calculate KPIs
   - Analyzed inventory levels, delivery performance, and stock movement  
3. Dashboard Development (Power BI)
   - Built interactive, multi-page dashboards
   - Focused on inventory health, logistics efficiency, and performance KPIs

📊 **Key Insights**
- Inventory levels are misaligned with sales velocity, indicating capital lock-in
- Several SKUs consistently show low movement but high stock levels
- Delivery delays are concentrated in specific regions, pointing to logistics bottlenecks
- Inventory availability does not always translate to faster fulfillment
These issues directly impact operational efficiency and cost optimization.

💡 **Business Recommendations**
- Optimize inventory replenishment using sales velocity and demand patterns
- Reduce overstocking of slow-moving products to free working capital
- Improve logistics planning in high-delay regions
- Monitor inventory health KPIs regularly to prevent inefficiencies

📈 **Dashboard Overview**
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Inventory health and stock movement tracking
- Logistics and delivery performance analysis
- KPI monitoring for operational decision-making
Designed for Supply Chain Managers, Operations Leads, and Inventory Planners.

🧠 **Business Decisions Enabled**
- Inventory optimization and stock prioritization
- Identification of logistics bottlenecks
- Supplier and product-level performance evaluation
- Data-driven replenishment and fulfillment planning
