📦 Supply Chain & Inventory Analytics
Python • SQL • Power BI Dashboard

🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from loading and exploring a dataset in Python to generating insights, building SQL queries, and designing a final dashboard and presentation.
The goal is to show strong analytical thinking, technical skills, and the ability to turn raw data into actionable insights.

The project includes:

- Loading and exploring the dataset

- Conducting EDA and cleaning the data

- Running SQL queries on MySQL Server

- Building an interactive dashboard

- Creating a written report

- Preparing a presentation for stakeholders

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains operational and performance metrics relevant to the business problem.
It includes fields such as:

- Product or customer details

- Sales or transaction data

- Dates, categories, and numerical metrics

- Operational KPIs such as cost, time, or performance indicators

The dataset is loaded into Python for exploration and stored in MySQL for querying.

🧮 Project Steps
Step 1: Load Dataset in Python

- Imported the dataset using Pandas

- Reviewed data types, structure, and completeness

- Identified missing values and inconsistencies

Step 2: Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values

- Removed duplicates

- Fixed inconsistent formatting

- Engineered new metrics

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Summary statistics

- Data distribution checks

- Correlation analysis

- Visualizations for trends and patterns

Step 4: SQL Analysis

Using MySQL Server:

- Imported the cleaned dataset into MySQL

- Created tables and relationships

- Wrote analytical queries for filtering, grouping, joining, and aggregation

- Generated insights that support dashboard creation

Step 5: Dashboard Creation

Designed an interactive dashboard with key insights:

- KPIs

- Charts and tables

- Filters for deeper exploration

- Visual storytelling to highlight trends and outliers

Step 6: Report Writing

A professional report was created summarizing:

- Business problem

- Approach

- Key findings

- Insights from Python, SQL, and the dashboard

- Recommendations

Step 7: Presentation (PPT)

Created a stakeholder-friendly PowerPoint including:

- Project objective

= Methods

- Visual highlights from the dashboard

- Final conclusions and business recommendations

📊 5. Dashboard Highlights
The final dashboard provides:

- Quick KPI overview

- Trend analysis

- Category-wise comparisons

- Drill-down capabilities

- Clear insight into performance drivers

This allows decision-makers to easily monitor progress and identify improvement areas.

✅ 6. Results & Key Insights
Some of the insights generated through the analysis include:

- Patterns and trends uncovered through EDA

- SQL-driven insights about relationships and performance

- Dashboard visuals that highlight significant opportunities and risks

- Recommendations that guide data-backed decision making

▶️ How to Run the Project
Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

- MySQL Server installed

- Power BI or your chosen BI tool

- Required Python libraries:

  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn mysql-connector-python

Steps

1. Clone the repository:

  git clone https://github.com/Harshitverma816/supply-chain-analysis.git 
  cd supply-chain-analysis

2. Open the Python notebook and run the EDA and data cleaning steps.

3. Import the cleaned dataset into MySQL.

4. Run the SQL scripts to generate analytical outputs.

5. Open the Power BI file and refresh the data source.

6. Review the final report and presentation.
